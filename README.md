Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is "The systematic use of engineering principles and methods to create and maintain high-quality software systems and applications.
Software Engineering aids the tech industry by providing the ability to develop reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that fulfill user needs.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The development of programming languages which have enabled faster developing of software and improved readability of code.
2.The establishment of software engineering as a field in 1960, creating foundational principles.
3.Agile methodologies being introduced in the 2000's promoting collaboration during development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: User and software requirements are gathered and documented
Design: User interface and software architecture designs are created.
Implementation: Coding/building the software according to design specifics.
Testing: Conducting tests to ensure funcyinal requirements and quality standards are met.
Deployment: Releasing the software to uers.
Maintenance: Updating and supporting the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: A sequential approach that has separate phases i.e requirements, design, and implementation that flow downward like a waterfall. Waterfall methodology is used when the project deliverables are well known.
Agile Methodology: An iterative and incremental strategy that focuses on flexibility, cooperation, and response to change. Suitable for projects with unclear requirements.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code and implementation of software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures quality of software by designing and conducting test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
VCS: Software tools that aid in tracking changes to source code and co-ordinating work among development teams. Example GIT
IDEs: Software suites that provide tools for writing, testing, and debugging code. Example Visual Studio.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: This can be overcome by using the agile methodolgy in development as it focuses on flexibility and response to change.
Tight deadlines: This can be overcome through prioritizing tasks and reassesing project timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
System testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptane testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure user needs have been met.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components of the software 
Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between the different system components

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
